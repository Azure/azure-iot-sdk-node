/**
 * The Azure IoT Service SDK for Node.js allows applications to interact with an Azure IoT hub with:
 * A messaging {@link azure-iothub.Client} using either AMQP or AMQP over Websockets that enables:
 * - sending cloud-to-device messages (also known as commands) to devices
 * - execute direct methods on devices
 * - listening for feedback when cloud-to-device messages are delivered
 * - listening for file upload notifications from devices
 *
 * It also supports Device identity registry operations with the {@link azure-iothub.Registry} object:
 * - creating, removing, updating, and listing device identities registered with an IoT hub
 * - get and update and query device twins
 *
 * Finally, the `{@link azure-iothub.JobClient} object allows to schedule long running tasks that:
 * - execute direct methods on one or more devices at a specific time
 * - update one or more device twins at a specific time
 *
 * @module azure-iothub
