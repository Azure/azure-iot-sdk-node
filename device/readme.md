# Azure IoT Node.js Device Client Library

The Azure IoT Node.js Device Client Library is can be used to build applications on devices that interact with Azure IoT Hub.

## Features

* Send event data to Azure IoT Hub.
* Receive messages from IoT Hub. 
* Support for multiple communications protocols, including MQTT (optionally over WebSockets), AMQP (optionally over WebSockets), or HTTP.
* Synchronize an Azure IoT Hub device Twin with Azure IoT Hub from a device
* Implement Azure IoT Hub Direct Device Methods on devices
* Implement Azure IoT Device Mangement features on devices

## How to use the Azure IoT device SDK for Node.js

* [Get started in minutes with the azure-iot-device npm package](./core/readme.md)
* [Check out the simple samples provided in this repository](./samples/)
* [Try out the Node-RED node for Azure IoT Hub](./node-red/)

## Directory structure

Device SDK subfolders:

### /core

Device SDK Client package. This is used in conjunction with a protocol implementation package coming from one of the `transport` folder.

### /transport

Protocol-specific SDK packages for: AMQP, AMQP over WebSockets, MQTT, MQTT over WebSockets and HTTP.

### /samples

Sample applications exercising basic features.

### /node-red

Sample Node-RED module for Azure IoT Hub.

*This is meant to serve only basic scenarios for testing and is not recommended as a production-ready node-red module.*
