### Errors

There are 2 failure modes for Twin requests:
- the initial request is rejected: in that case, the error shall be translated using the usual `azure-iot-amqp-base.translateError` function
- the request is accepted but contains an invalid payload and leads to an error: in that case, the response sent on the receiver link will have a status code > 300 and shall be translated using **SRS_NODE_DEVICE_AMQP_TWIN_16_037**:

**SRS_NODE_DEVICE_AMQP_TWIN_16_037: [** The responses containing errors received on the receiver link shall be translated according to the following table:
| statusCode | ErrorType               |
| ---------- | ------------------------|
| 400        | FormatError             |
| 401        | UnauthorizedError       |
| 403        | InvalidOperationError   |
| 404        | DeviceNotFoundError     |
| 429        | ThrottlingError         |
| 500        | InternalServerError     |
| 503        | ServiceUnavailableError |
