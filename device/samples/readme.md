# Samples for the Azure IoT device SDK for Node.js

This folder contains simple samples showing how to use the various features of the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub service from a device running JavaScript code.

*How to run a sample in your own folder using published npm packages.*

**1) Make sure you have the prerequisites**

In order to run the device samples you will first need the following prerequisites:
* The latest or LTS version of Node.js on your device. (Check out [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for more info)
* An Azure IoT Hub instance. [(Link if you don't.)][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
* A device identity for your device. [(Link if you don't.)][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

**2) Grab the right files**

Once you have the prerequisites, get the following files from the current folder:
* **package.json**
* **__sample_file.js__** (where **__sample_file.js__** is one of the files listed above and available in this folder)

Copy them into your directory of choice. Once they've been placed in that directory, navigate using a terminal window to the folder. Then execute the following command:
```
npm install
```

This should install the proper dependencies as specified in the **package.json** you copied.

**3) Set the DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable**

* From a shell or Node.js command prompt, navigate to the folder where you placed the sample files. 
* Set the `DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable: 

*in bash*
```bash
export DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING="<YourIoTHubConnectionString>"
```
*in powershell*
```powershell
$env:DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING="<YourIoTHubConnectionString>"
```


**4) Run it**

Run the sample application using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
node sample_file.js
```

## Read this if you want to run a sample in VS Code

**1) Do steps 1 and 2 above**

**2) Open Visual Studio Code**

Open the folder containing your Node.js project in Visual Studio Code.

**3) Set up the Debug Configuration**

* Click on the *Debug* tab. (also `ctrl-shift-D`)
* Find the little gear and click on it (When hovered over it says "Open launch.json")
* Add the following launch configuration:

```json
{
   "type": "node",
   "request": "launch",
   "name": "IoT Hub Sample Device",
   "program": "${workspaceFolder}/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js",
   "protocol": "inspector",
   "sourceMaps": true,
   "console": "integratedTerminal",
   "env": {
      "DEBUG": "mqtt*,rhea*,azure*",
      "NODE_ENV": "development",
      "DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING": "<YourConnectionString>"
   },
   "outFiles": [
      "${workspaceFolder}/common/core/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/common/transport/amqp/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/common/transport/http/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/common/transport/mqtt/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/device/core/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/device/transport/amqp/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/device/transport/http/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/device/transport/mqtt/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/dtclient/lib/*.js",
      "${workspaceFolder}/service/lib/*.js",
   ]
}
```
* Edit the `DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to use your IoT Hub device connection string.
* Edit the `program` to the path to the code you want to run. 
* If you do not want debug logs to be printed, delete the `DEBUG` environment variable. Otherwise you can leave it as it is.

**4) Run it**

* In the debug tab, click on the configuration drop down and select `IoT Hub Sample Device`, then press `Start Debugging`.


## List of samples
