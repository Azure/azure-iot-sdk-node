# Azure IoT SDK Node Samples

Welcome to our new samples page for the Node.js Azure IoT Device SDK. We have organized the samples into three different buckets to provide you a better developer experience.

- **[Getting started](./getting_started)**: For those folks just getting started and looking to learn the basics. 
- **Edge modules**: Using the SDK in Azure IoT Edge modules.
- **How to guides**: Scenario based examples for Azure IoT device builders.

> An important note. These samples are for education purposes only. They are not designed to cut and pasted into product code.

## [Getting started (level 100)](./getting_started)

If are new to the Azure IoT Device SDK, this is the place to start. These samples will help get you up to speed with the basics in just a few minutes. Some of the concepts we cover in the getting started samples are:

- [Creating a connection](./getting_started/connections)
- [Sending telemetry messages](./getting_started/send_messages)
- [Receive cloud to device message](./getting_started/receive_messages)
- [Receive cloud to device method invocation](./getting_started/receive_method_invocation)
- [Device twins](getting_started/device_twins)
- [Upload files](./getting_started/upload_files)

If this is your first time here, we suggest you start with the [send messages](./getting_started/send_messages) sample.

## [How to guides (level 200-300)](./how_to_guides)

Once you have become familair with the [getting started](getting_started) samples, you may be interested in the next level of samples. These "how-to-guides" are samples that support more complicated scenerios on advanced capabilties. They include scenarios like device provisioning, plug and play, and more.

- [Register and connect a device using the Device Provisioning service](./how_to_guides/device_provisioning)
- [Enabling and using devices with Plug and Play](./how_to_guides/plug_and_play)
- [Use Device Twins to reboot a device](./how_to_guides/device_reboot)

## [Edge modules (level 100-200)](./edge_modules)
