# How to guides (level 200-300)

These samples support more complicated scenerios on advanced capabilties. They include scenarios like device provisioning, plug and play, and more.

ðŸ”” If you are just starting with Azure IoT device SDK's, we recommend you start with the basic [send messages to IoT Hub](../getting_started/send_messages) example.

## [Register and connect a device using the Device Provisioning service](device_provisioning)

The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention. DPS enables the provisioning of millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

## [Enabling and using devices with Plug and Play](plug_and_play)

IoT Plug and Play enables solution builders to integrate IoT devices with their solutions without any manual configuration. At the core of IoT Plug and Play, is a device model that a device uses to advertise its capabilities to an IoT Plug and Play-enabled application.

## [Reboot a device](device_reboot)

Use device twins and cloud-to-device method invocations to simulate rebooting a physical device.

## [Update device firmware](device_update)

Use device twins and cloud-to-device method invocations to simulate updating the firmware on a device.

# Next Steps
