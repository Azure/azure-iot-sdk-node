## How to use the Azure IoT SDKs for Node.js

Devices and data sources in an IoT solution can range from a simple network-connected sensor to a powerful, standalone computing device. Devices may have limited processing capability, memory, communication bandwidth, and communication protocol support. The IoT device SDKs enable you to implement client applications for a wide variety of devices.

The SDK team publishes the SDKs as [npm](https://npmjs.org) packages:

## Key features and roadmap

Here's a [feature matrix](./feature_matrix.md) that will help you understand what feature is supported with which protocol.

## Samples

In the repository, you will find a set of simple samples that will help you get started:
- [Device SDK samples](./device/samples/)
- [Service SDK samples](./service/samples/)

## Platforms compatibility

The Azure IoT SDK for Node.js *should work* with versions of Node.js as old as v0.10.x. this being said, a lot of dependencies are slowly dropping support for these older versions and we really have no control over that.

It is recommended to update to at least a [current or active version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) of Node.js. (v10.x.x. as of 15/05/2019)

## Contribution, feedback and issues

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.

## Schedule<sup>1</sup>

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the package versions released

| NPM Package | Github Branch | LTS Status | LTS Start Date | Maintenance End Date | Removed Date |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :------------: | :------------------: | :----------: |
| 1.7.x         | [lts_09_2018](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/lts_09_2018)   | Active     | 2018-09-16     | 2018-09-16           | 2019-09-16   |
