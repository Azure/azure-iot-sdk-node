# azure-iot-provisioning-device-mqtt

The `Mqtt` and `MqttWs` classes provides the Provisioning Device SDK with a transport for x509 registration flows over Mqtt. It is instantiated by SDK users only to be passed to the `ProvisioningDeviceClient` object and does not have a public API.

# Internal API

These methods are used by the other objects of the SDK but are not public API for the SDK user to call.
